//! Segment trait for cache storage.
//!
//! A segment is a fixed-size memory region that stores cache items sequentially.
//! Items are appended to the segment until it's full, then the segment is sealed
//! and a new one is allocated.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - [`Segment`] - Core trait for segment operations
//! - [`SegmentGuard`] - Extension trait for zero-copy access
//! - [`SegmentCopy`] - Extension trait for tier migration
//! - [`SegmentPrune`] - Extension trait for merge eviction

/// Trait for a cache segment.
///
/// Segments are the fundamental storage unit in segment-based caches.
/// They provide:
/// - Sequential item storage with atomic append
/// - State machine for concurrent access control
/// - Chain pointers for linked list organization (TTL buckets, FIFO, etc.)
/// - Reference counting for safe concurrent reads
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// Segment operations use atomic primitives and CAS loops for thread safety.
/// The state machine ensures that:
/// - Only `Live` segments accept writes
/// - Only `Live`, `Sealed`, and `Relinking` segments allow reads
/// - Reference counting prevents clearing segments with active readers
///
/// # TTL Handling
///
/// Segments support two TTL models:
/// - **Segment-level TTL**: All items share `expire_at()`, stored in segment metadata
/// - **Per-item TTL**: Each item has individual TTL in `TtlHeader`
///
/// Use `item_ttl()` to get the TTL of a specific item, which will return the
/// appropriate TTL based on how the segment stores TTL information.
