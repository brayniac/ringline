//! Segment state machine and packed metadata.
//!
//! This module defines the segment lifecycle states and provides a packed
//! representation for atomic state transitions.

/// Sentinel value for invalid/unset segment IDs in chain pointers.
/// Uses 24-bit max value since segment IDs are packed into 24 bits.
pub const INVALID_SEGMENT_ID: u32 = 0xFF_FFFF;

/// State of a segment in its lifecycle.
///
/// # State Semantics
///
/// - **Free**: In free queue, available for allocation
/// - **Reserved**: Allocated for use, being prepared for chain insertion
/// - **Linking**: Being added to a chain (next/prev being set)
/// - **Live**: Active tail segment accepting writes and reads
/// - **Sealed**: No more writes accepted, but data readable and chain stable
/// - **Relinking**: Chain pointers being updated during neighbor removal.
///   Data remains readable, only next/prev pointers are being modified.
/// - **Draining**: Segment is being processed (merge eviction or removal).
///   Provides exclusive access - only one thread can hold a segment in Draining.
///   New reads are rejected; must wait for ref_count to drop before modifying data.
/// - **Locked**: Being cleared, all access rejected

    /// Eviction Thread:                    Reader Thread:
    /// --------------------------------    --------------------------------
    /// 1. Check ref_count == 0
    /// 2. CAS: Draining -> AwaitingRelease
    /// 3. Update hashtable (remove key)
    ///                                    4. Increment ref_count
    ///                                    5. Read data
    ///                                    6. Decrement ref_count in Drop
    ///                                    7. If prev_count == 1:
    ///                                       - Check state == AwaitingRelease
    ///                                       - CAS: AwaitingRelease -> Free
    ///                                       - Push segment to free queue
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Why This Pattern?
    ///
    /// The race condition this solves:
    /// - Eviction thread sees ref_count == 0
    /// - Before eviction CAS, a reader increments ref_count
    /// - Eviction thread transitions to AwaitingRelease
    /// - Reader's Drop sees AwaitingRelease and frees the segment
    ///
    /// ## Memory Ordering
    ///
    /// - Release fence when decrementing ref_count (ensures all reads
    ///   complete before checking state)
    /// - Acquire fence when reading state (ensures we see the
    ///   AwaitingRelease written by eviction thread)
    /// - AcqRel for the final CAS (combines acquire/release semantics)
    ///
    /// ## Safety Guarantees
    ///
    /// - Segment memory remains valid as long as ref_count > 0
    /// - The last reader (seeing AwaitingRelease) is responsible for freeing
    /// - Double-free is prevented by the CAS (only one thread succeeds)
