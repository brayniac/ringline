//! Hashtable trait and key verification for cache operations.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - [`Hashtable`] - Core trait for key -> (location, frequency) mapping
//! - [`KeyVerifier`] - Trait for verifying keys at locations
//! - Support for ghost entries that preserve frequency after eviction

/// Trait for verifying that a key exists at a location.
///
/// The hashtable calls this during lookup/insert to confirm that a tag match
/// corresponds to an actual key match (avoiding false positives from hash
/// collisions in the 12-bit tag).
///
/// # Implementors
///
/// Storage backends implement this trait to provide key verification:
/// - Segment caches: Verify key in segment at offset
/// - Arc caches: Verify key in slot at index
/// - SSD-backed caches: Verify key from disk
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) as verification may be
/// called concurrently from multiple threads.
pub trait KeyVerifier: Send + Sync {
    /// Verify that `key` exists at `location`.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `key`: The key to verify
    /// - `location`: The opaque location to check
    /// - `allow_deleted`: If `true`, match even if item is marked deleted
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// `true` if the key matches at this location.
    fn verify(&self, key: &[u8], location: Location, allow_deleted: bool) -> bool;

    /// Prefetch memory at the given location.
    ///
    /// Called by the hashtable after a tag match but before full verification.
    /// This allows overlapping memory prefetch with the Acquire barrier overhead.
    ///
    /// The default implementation is a no-op. Segment-based verifiers can
    /// override this to prefetch the segment memory at the given offset.

/// Core trait for hashtable operations.
///
/// A hashtable maps keys to `Location` values, tracking the physical
/// location of items in storage. It also maintains frequency counters
/// for each item, supporting eviction algorithms like S3FIFO.
///
/// # Ghost Entries
///
/// When an item is evicted, its hashtable entry can be converted to a "ghost"
/// entry. Ghosts preserve the frequency counter but mark the location as invalid
/// (`Location::GHOST`). When re-inserting a previously evicted key, the ghost's
/// frequency can be preserved, giving "second chance" semantics.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`). The cuckoo hashtable
/// implementation uses lock-free CAS operations for all mutations.
