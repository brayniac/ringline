//! The sockets of one bound listener, shared by everything that uses them.
//!
//! `launch()` creates one [`ListenerSockets`] per `bind*()` call. Until
//! shutdown, `RuntimeShutdown` and the listen gates each hold an `Arc` of it;
//! the listener's acceptor thread (pool mode) or every worker (merged mode)
//! holds one until it exits. The `Runtime` holds a `Weak`. An fd number stays
//! valid for as long as anything that passes it to a syscall holds the `Arc`.
//!
//! Shutdown does not close the sockets. [`ListenerSockets::shut_down`] stops
//! them accepting, `RuntimeShutdown` and the gates drop their `Arc`s, and the
//! sockets close when the threads accepting on them exit.
