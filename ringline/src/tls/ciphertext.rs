//! Incoming-ciphertext buffer for the unbuffered TLS engine.
//!
//! rustls' `process_tls_records` takes a contiguous `&mut [u8]` whose front is
//! the next unprocessed byte, and requires the caller to remove `discard` bytes
//! from that front before calling again. A wrapping ring cannot satisfy the
//! contiguity requirement, and a naive `drain(..discard)` memmoves the
//! remainder on every call — the O(N*K) shape fixed in #279.
//!
//! This is a linear buffer with a start offset: `discard` is O(1). Relocation
//! (compaction) is amortized O(1) per byte because compaction only runs when
//! it pays for itself — when the bytes it moves are no more than the bytes it
//! reclaims (`start >= live`) — and it is tried *before* growth, so the
//! resident allocation tracks the working set rather than ballooning to `cap`.
//! A buffer that is full of *live* data (no productive compaction possible and
//! no room left to grow within `cap`) returns `WouldBlock` from `append`
//! rather than degrading into an unamortized memmove; the caller must drain
//! before appending more. `MIN_CIPHERTEXT_CAP` is sized so that `WouldBlock`
//! can only fire when the caller already holds a complete, drainable message —
//! see its doc comment for the argument. Halving it reintroduces a remotely
//! triggerable hang.
//!
//! Callers must not `append` between reading an `UnbufferedStatus` from
//! `process_tls_records` and calling the corresponding `discard`: `discard`'s
//! byte count is relative to the slice length at the moment that status was
//! produced, and an intervening `append` would shift what it actually removes.
