//! mio-facing TLS entry points, dispatching by engine.
//!
//! The mio backend writes ciphertext into `Vec<u8>` buffers queued on the
//! connection's `pending_sends` FIFO (there is no send-pool slot lifecycle to
//! respect, and no SQE whose memory must outlive the call). Both engines
//! therefore produce plain byte vectors here; only the engine that fills them
//! differs.
//!
//! Each function keeps the name and signature the backend already called, so
//! `backend/mio/{event_loop,driver}.rs` and `handler.rs` are unaware of which
//! record layer is compiled in. The buffered halves live in
//! [`super::buffered`] under `*_buffered` names.
//!
//! **Never drive the state machine to "flush" leftovers after encrypting or
//! queueing an alert.** rustls' `write_fragments` drains `sendable_tls` into
//! the *front* of the destination buffer ahead of the fragments it is about to
//! encrypt, and `check_required_size` reserves that space (verified against
//! rustls 0.23.41's `CommonState`). Anything already queued — a TLS 1.3
//! `key_update`, most notably — therefore rides out inside the destination,
//! correctly ordered. Driving afterwards and queueing that output as a
//! separate send puts it *after* those records on the wire, and the peer fails
//! with `bad_record_mac`. See `docs/tls-unbuffered-design.md`.
