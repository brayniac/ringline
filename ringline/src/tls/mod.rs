//! TLS support.
//!
//! Shared types live here; the record-layer implementation lives in the engine
//! submodules. `buffered` drives rustls' buffered `Connection` API
//! (`read_tls`/`process_new_packets`/`write_tls`).
//!
//! `TlsConnKind` is tagged by engine: [`TlsConnKind::Buffered`] wraps
//! [`buffered::BufferedKind`], which carries the buffered-only surface
//! (`read_tls`/`write_tls`/`process_new_packets`/`reader`/`writer`/
//! `send_close_notify`). `send_close_notify` lives there rather than on
//! `TlsConnKind` because it isn't actually `CommonState`-reachable from the
//! unbuffered connection types (`UnbufferedConnectionCommon` derefs to
//! `CommonState` but doesn't `DerefMut` to it) — a shared-looking method
//! name that turned out to be buffered-only once checked against rustls
//! 0.23.41, the same way `read_tls` et al. are. `TlsConnKind` itself keeps
//! only the methods rustls exposes through `CommonState` and that are
//! actually reachable that way from every engine's connection type — so the
//! feature-gated [`TlsConnKind::Unbuffered`] variant (wrapping
//! [`unbuffered::UnbufferedConn`]) adds a match arm to those, rather than
//! forcing every caller to unwrap an engine first.
//!
//! Which engine drives a connection is decided once, in
//! [`TlsTable::create`]/[`TlsTable::create_client`], by the `tls-unbuffered`
//! cargo feature. Backends never see that choice: `backend_mio` and
//! `backend_uring` each dispatch their backend's entry points to whichever
//! engine is compiled in, keeping the names and signatures the backend already
//! called. `drain_tls_plaintext` below is the buffered engine's plaintext
//! drain and is reached only from `buffered` (the unbuffered engine drains
//! `ReadTraffic` itself); it is not an engine-agnostic helper despite living
//! here.
