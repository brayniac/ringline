//! Per-listener listen gates.
//!
//! A listener is bound when the runtime launches, which reserves its port, and
//! begins listening when its gate opens. Between the two the kernel does not
//! complete handshakes, so a readiness probe fails while the server is not
//! ready instead of passing against a socket nothing will service.
//!
//! What the peer sees in that window is platform-specific: Linux answers the
//! SYN with RST, so the connect is refused immediately, while macOS and the
//! BSDs drop it and the peer times out. Both fail a probe; only the first
//! fails it quickly.
//!
//! Gates are open by default: [`RinglineBuilder::defer_listen`] closes a gate
//! and [`begin_listening`] opens it. A listener that is not deferred is
//! listening before `launch()` returns.
//!
//! The gate defers `listen(2)`, not `accept(2)`. A socket that is listening
//! but not accepting still completes handshakes, so a TCP readiness probe
//! against it passes.
//!
