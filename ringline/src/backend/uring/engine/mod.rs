//! The engine executes the operations the driver submits and reports their
//! completions. [`UringEngine`](uring::UringEngine) is the kernel's
//! io_uring. Building with the environment variable
//! `RINGLINE_STUB_ENGINE=1` selects [`StubEngine`](stub::StubEngine)
//! instead, which compiles the driver without the `io_uring` crate and
//! fails at setup.
