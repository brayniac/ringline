/// run on the parking worker — closing the fixed-file entry drops per-worker
/// state without sending a FIN, because this handle keeps the socket alive.
// On mio nothing reads these: park is io_uring-only, but `Config` names the
// type on both backends.

///
/// # Why this is not statically typed
///
/// The state crosses from a connection handle to the handler, and
/// `Connection`/`ConnCtx` are plain tokens — not generic over the handler
/// type. So the deposit site cannot name the handler's state type, and an
/// associated type on the handler trait would give a typed *take* while
/// leaving the *deposit* untyped: the mismatch would move rather than
/// disappear. Making it genuinely static would mean threading the handler
/// type through every connection handle.
///
/// So the erasure is kept explicit and in one place, and a mismatch is made
/// loud instead: [`ParkState::take`] panics in debug builds naming both
/// types, so the wrong type fails on the first test run rather than silently
/// adopting with no state.
