//! What happens when a task panics.
//!
//! A panic in user code that the runtime polls or calls on a worker is caught:
//! connection tasks; standalone tasks from `spawn` and `spawn_with_handle`;
//! the futures returned by `on_start` and `on_udp_bind`, and the calls that
//! build them; building the `on_accept` (or `on_adopt`) future; `on_tick`;
//! `on_notify`; and, on the blocking pool, `spawn_blocking` closures.
//!
//! A future's `Drop` run by [`JoinHandle::abort`](crate::JoinHandle::abort) or
//! [`TaskId::cancel`](crate::TaskId::cancel) runs inside the cancelling task's
//! poll, so a panic there is reported as that task's panic.
//!
//! Not covered: a future's `Drop` while a worker drains at shutdown, which
//! unwinds the worker thread, and `create_for_worker`, whose panic fails
//! `launch()`.
//!
//! By default ([`TaskPanicPolicy::Contain`]) a caught panic is contained: the
//! task is dropped, a connection task's connection is closed, the worker keeps
//! running, and a handle awaiting the task resolves to a [`JoinError`]. With
//! [`TaskPanicPolicy::Shutdown`] a panic also shuts the runtime down.
