/// Trait for async connection handlers.
///
/// Consumers implement this trait to handle connections using `async fn` code
/// instead of push-based
/// callbacks. Each accepted connection gets a long-lived async task that runs
/// for the connection's lifetime.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::future::Future;
/// use ringline::{AsyncEventHandler, Connection, ParseResult};
///
/// struct EchoHandler;
///
/// impl AsyncEventHandler for EchoHandler {
///     fn on_accept(&self, mut conn: Connection) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + 'static {
///         async move {
///             let (mut tx, mut rx) = conn.split();
///             loop {
///                 let n = rx.with_data(|data| {
///                     // Echo back everything received.
///                     tx.send_nowait(data).ok();
///                     ringline::ParseResult::Consumed(data.len())
///                 }).await;
///                 if n == 0 {
///                     break;
///                 }
///             }
///         }
